# ===================================================

# The ID of the Discord role to apply to muted/banned players
# To get a role ID: Enable Developer Mode in Discord > Right-click the role > Copy ID
# If this is set to "0" or left empty, only message deletion will be used (role features disabled)

# ===================================================
# Timing Settings
# ===================================================

# How often to check for expired punishments (in minutes)
# When a punishment expires, the Discord role/mute will be automatically removed
# Lower values = more responsive but more database queries
# Recommended: 5-10 minutes

# Delay before initializing DiscordSRV integration (in seconds)
# Gives DiscordSRV time to fully load on server startup
# Only change if you experience initialization issues
